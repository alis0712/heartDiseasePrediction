# Heart Disease Prediction Model 

### The use of predictive models in predicting heart disease has gained significant attention in cardiovascular research.Â 

### Numerous studies have explored the development of accurate and reliable models to identify individuals at risk of heart disease, allowing for early intervention and personalized treatment strategies. 

### In this project, we present a novel predictive model based on the Framingham dataset, a widely recognized and extensively studied dataset in the field of cardiovascular research.

### The main objective is to develop a reliable and practical tool that can assist healthcare providers in identifying individuals at risk of developing Coronary Heart Disease (CHD) and guide appropriate preventive measures. By addressing these goals, a classification model for predicting the 10-year risk of CHD can assist in risk assessment, prevention strategies, and early intervention, leading to better patient outcomes and reduced burden of CHD.

# TODO: Format the program so that it can be used as an app which allows doctors to monitor and predict the risk of developing Coronary Heart Disease.
